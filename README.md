# Garage Laser
A ceiling-mounted laser to aid in positioning cars in the garage.

I got frustrated with the usual tennis ball on a string method for positioning the cars in the garage. This gadget projects a red laser spot down from the ceiling to help align the car to the right position in the garage. The finished project is shown below:
